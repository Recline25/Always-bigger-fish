# CMPG323-Ex1
This line of code was done for a kata on codewars, the kata in question was to remove all the spaces in a sentence.
The code was for a java kata and initially I wrote a decent amount of loops and other stuff and submitted the code, it worked but then I went trough the other answers and stumbled apon this one line that did everything my paragragh did in one line. 

My normal approach to problems are to see the problem, understand it, see wat a solution should look like and work to try and achieve that solution. If the solution doesn't work then try another method or way.
